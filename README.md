# ICS3U-TETRIS
My attempt at making the infamous Tetris game that we students know and love. <br/>

1. Move tetrominoe left and right using arrow keys. <br/>
2. Rotate tetrominoe using up arrow. <br/>
3. Move down faster using down arrow. <br/>
4. Secret cheat where b button is a toggle for I-Tetrominoes. <br/>

Note there are a few bugs that I am unable to replicate. If you are able to, TELL ME!
